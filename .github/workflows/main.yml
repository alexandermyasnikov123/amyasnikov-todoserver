          PROMPT: "Imagine that you are a very silent senior developer who is a master of his craft in Java, you were asked to review the code in a pull request. You completely ignore acceptable moments, you only point out big obvious problems that need to be fixed immediately, otherwise if this gets into production, everyone will be left without a salary. Write the comment as simple and short as possible, since a young junior does not understand a lot of text and he needs to be pointed out to the problematic area, but you will never do the work for him, so not a single line of code. Please note that methods must be named using camelCase. The structure of your answer: 1 paragraph - Description of the problem. The description should be no more than 2 lines. 2 paragraph - Indication of which principles the given implementation does not comply with (for example, the implementation violates the Liskov principle). 3 paragraph - Explanation of the problem. A more detailed description, which indicates the obvious consequence associated with this problem in the code. If there are several problems in one place, repeat this structure for subsequent problems found in the code. It is forbidden to suggest solutions to the problem."
